# 449-SOS-Project
A project for class CS 449.

This was written with **Java 17 and Maven 3.9.6**

This project is a Maven Project so if you would like to make sure it is running properly. 
1. Pull the project locally into intellij 
2. take the runConfigurations folder and place it **into** your local .idea folder.
3. **Completely** close and reopen intellij
4. On the top right you should see a **SOSGAMERUNNER** run configuration that you can use.


This will run the mvn clean install (which will run the test for you ensuring that the game is stable before playing).
After it will run the game automatically.

I felt like this would be the easiest way for anyone to be able to run this locally.
